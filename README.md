## Document
- This is a simple card game where you have to find the pairs of cards.
- Currently you can choose three types of amounts of cards. (small = 8, medium = 12 and large = 16)
- After you selected a type( or size), if you found a pair you'll get a point. (on top of the right corner)
- A pair of cards equal 1 point.
- You can restart the game everytime, if you click on the button on the top of the left corner.
- If you found all of the pairs of cards and you'd like to try again, you need to click on the button on the top of the left corner.

The design is minimalist, because the javascript was the main thing in this little project.
